The db should have 
  - a unique id
  - time of entry
  - title of entry
  - desc of entry
  - who made the entry

After finishing, 
we'll create a backend api that will receive a db file
and sync, and send the updated db to app.

Maybe we can loop through the added rows from local db, and add their data to main db

*you can make a widget build loop if you put a function that has setState inside the build
